# Maximizing Hotel Revenue through Inferential and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project, part 2 in a series exploring the fundamentals of logistic regression, focuses on developing a predictive model to identify hotel bookings at risk of cancellation. Building upon the foundation laid in the previous project, where we focused on creating synthetic datasets, hyperparameter tuning, model performance analysis, and in-depth statistical evaluations, we now apply logistic regression to a real-world problem. By leveraging machine learning techniques and an extensive dataset, we aim to create a tool that enables hotels to proactively mitigate losses from cancellations, optimize revenue, and enhance customer loyalty.

## Highlights
- **Thorough Data Preprocessing**: Demonstrates best practices in data cleaning, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovers insightful trends in cancellations by country, month, and hotel type, guiding feature selection and model development.
- **Model Building and Tuning**: Constructs and fine-tunes logistic regression and random forest models using `sklearn`, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Employs a range of evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and ROC-AUC analysis, to assess model performance and inform selection.

## Key Concepts
- Understanding the business impact of cancellations and the value of predictive modeling in the hospitality industry.
- Applying data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality and model performance.
- Leveraging EDA to gain insights into cancellation patterns and guide feature selection.
- Building and tuning machine learning models for binary classification tasks.
- Evaluating model performance using a variety of metrics and selecting the most suitable model based on business requirements.

## Goal
To develop a robust and interpretable predictive model that empowers hotels to proactively identify and mitigate the risk of cancellations, ultimately optimizing revenue and enhancing customer loyalty.
